# Hide-WordPress-Admin-Help-and-Screen-Options
This versatile piece of code allows you to customize the WordPress admin interface by hiding the Help tab and Screen Options tab based on user roles and preferences.

**What Does This Code Snippet Do?**

The WordPress admin interface is incredibly flexible, but sometimes you may want to streamline it for certain users or to eliminate distractions. This code snippet provides two separate functionalities:

Hide the Help Tab: It allows you to hide the "Help" tab in the WordPress admin dashboard for specific user roles or globally. This can declutter the interface, making it more user-friendly for your team.

Hide the Screen Options Tab: It enables you to hide the "Screen Options" tab, which allows users to customize the display of dashboard elements. By hiding this tab, you can ensure a consistent and focused dashboard layout for your users.

**How to Use This Code Snippet**

If you want to customize the WordPress admin interface using this code snippet, follow these simple steps:

Access Your Theme's functions.php File:

Log in to your WordPress dashboard.
Go to "Appearance" > "Theme Editor."
Select your active theme.
Add the Code Snippet to functions.php:

On the right side, find and click on the functions.php file.
Scroll to the bottom of the file and paste the following code snippet:

```

function hide_help() {
    if (is_admin()) {
        echo '<style type="text/css">
                #contextual-help-link-wrap { display: none !important; }
              </style>';
    }
}
add_action('admin_head', 'hide_help');

```

This part of the code will hide the Help tab.

**Save Changes:**

Click the "Update File" button to save your changes.
Customize Screen Options (Optional):

If you want to customize the Screen Options tab, you can paste the following code snippet below the previous one:

```
function wpb_remove_screen_options() { 
    if (!current_user_can('manage_options')) {
        return false;
    }
    return true; 
}
add_filter('screen_options_show_screen', 'wpb_remove_screen_options');

```

This part of the code allows you to hide the Screen Options tab for users who do not have the "manage_options" capability (typically administrators).

**Save Changes Again:**

Click the "Update File" button to save both code snippets.

**Customization**

You can customize this code snippet further by adjusting user roles or capabilities to control who sees the Help and Screen Options tabs. For instance, you can modify the current_user_can() function to match specific roles or capabilities.
